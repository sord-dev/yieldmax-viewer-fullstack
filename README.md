# Fullstack YieldMax application launcher
Midway into development of this I realised that I'm much too young to be looking into high yielding dividend stocks, ion even have a fuckin' house yet dawg.

**How to run:**

In a cmd terminal either run the following commands

For a instant start of the production version:
```cmd
> ./run.cmd
```
Note: You can make a windows shortcut out of this too.

For a help sheet of the launcher.js options:
```cmd
> npm run help
```
